# Lightning Talks

A collection of tools and/or approaches which have been deemed worthy of sharing for a couple of minutes (hence the name Lightning Talks). Some you may find useful, some you may not. It is by no means considered to be a complete list.

Feel free to add your own. The theme is to at least maintain a connection between productivity and things which might help a web developer.
